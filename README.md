 **Problem Statement**
 
This project will conduct an analysis of the Iris data set. As part of this analysis the project will utilise python code. Detailed explanations of the python code for the user will be provided; specifically, on the journey of analysing a data set with Python. This project will create a program that:

  - outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
  
  - saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
  
  - outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
  
  **Introduction**
  
The iris dataset was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 in his paper "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems"  Essentially the Iris data set contains the following data:

50 samples of 3 different species of iris (150 total); 

Types of Species: the Iris Setosa, the Iris Versicolor and the Iris Virginic;

Four measurements of each species: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.
