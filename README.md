 **Problem statement
 
This project will conduct an analysis of the Iris data set. As part of this analysis the project will utilise python code. Detailed explanations of the python code for the user will be provided; specifically, on the journey of analysing a data set with Python. This project will create a program that:
  • outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
  • saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
  • outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
