 Problem statement 
  This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set [3]. You must research
the data set and write documentation and code (in Python [1] to investigate it. An
online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have
investigated it previously.
You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are
easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed. You might
do that for this project as follows:
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
• outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
• saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
• outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
It might help to suppose that your manager has asked you to investigate the data
set, with a view to explaining it to your colleagues. Imagine that you are to give a
presentation on the data set in a few weeks’ time, where you explain what investigating
a data set entails and how Python can be used to do it. You have not been asked to
create a deck of presentation slides, but rather to present your code and its output to
them
