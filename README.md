## Introduction
  
The purpose of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis of the Iris data set. This project forms part of the Programing and Scripting module assessment for GMITs Data Analytics higher Diploma course. The full set of project deliverables, instructions and grading criteria can be found [here.]( )

The iris dataset was first introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 in his paper "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems". 
Ronald Fisher was a British statistician who made impressive strides in the field of modern statistical science.  The Iris data set is well known throughout the world of statistics and is commonly utilised for exploratory data analysis. The Iris  data set is sometimes referred to as the Anderson’s Iris data set, simply because Edgar Anderson was the individual who collected the data on the Iris flowers which was subsequently used.

Essentially the Iris data set contains the following data:

The data set contains the following:

•	Three types of Species: 
1. The Iris Setosa.
2. The Iris Versicolor. 
3. The Iris Virginic.

•	Four measurements of each species:

1. Sepal length.
2. Sepal width.
3. Petal length. 
4. Petal width.

•	Fifty samples of Iris flower from each species (150 total). 

The flowers are measured in centimetres of four columns, the fifth column details the species type. The data for the Iris data set is extracted from a CSV, this data set is plentiful and readily available on multiple sources on the internet. For example, the raw CSV Irish data set can be found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/curran/a08a1080b88344b0c8a7/raw/639388c2cbc2120a14dcf466e85730eb8be498bb/iris.csv
). 

 ## Problem Statement
 
This project will conduct an analysis of the Iris data set. As part of this analysis the project will utilise python code. Detailed explanations of the python code for the user will be provided; specifically, on the journey of analysing a data set with Python. This project will create a program that:

  - outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
  
  - saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
  
  - outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.


## Libraries

 The following Python libraries are used to conduct the data analysis of the Iris data set:
 
 1. pandas- pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.
 2. numpy- provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.
 3. matplotlib- is a plotting library and allows for the production of graphs, plots and charts. 
 4. seaborn- is a Python data visualisation library based on matplotlib, it provides a high-level interface for graphics.
 
## Getting Started

In order to conduct an effective analysis of the the Iris data set you must have the relevant libraries installed as listed above. The Iris data set must be in a CSV type flie format and located in the same directory as the python code. Please ensure that you have the origional version of the Iris data set, otherwise some data cleaning may be required.
